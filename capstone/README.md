A project to help restaurants quickly connect to their patrons.

Makes use of:
https://github.com/SmileyChris/django-countries/
https://pypi.org/project/django-google-maps/
https://github.com/stefanfoulis/django-phonenumber-field

### How to run the application

Launching the application you can jump right in, creating new restaurants after you've registered to the site! It does not pull data about restaurants from google maps, so new restaurant creation is vital to the use of the website.
